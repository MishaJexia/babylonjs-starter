# babylonjs-starter

## Requirements

This package has been developed with `NodeJS v12.6.0`. It should work with other versions, but I cannot guarantee that.

## Setup

```shell
$ yarn install
```

## Start the development server

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

After that, open your browser at `http://localhost:1234`.

## Build

```shell
$ yarn build
````
